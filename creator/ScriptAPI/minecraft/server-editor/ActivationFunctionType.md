# ActivationFunctionType Type Alias

Callback type when an extension instance is activated for a given player. It is expected to return an array of disposables that will automatically be cleaned up on shutdown.

## Declaration
`export type ActivationFunctionType<PerPlayerStorageType> = (uiSession: IPlayerUISession<PerPlayerStorageType>) => IDisposable[];`
