# WatchdogTerminateReason Enumeration

> [!CAUTION]
> This enum is still in pre-release.  Its signature may change or it may be removed in future releases.

An enumeration with the reason that a watchdog is deciding to terminate execution of a behavior packs' script.

## Constants
### **Hang**
`Hang = "Hang"`

Script runtime for a behavior pack is terminated due to non-responsiveness from script (a hang or infinite loop).
### **StackOverflow**
`StackOverflow = "StackOverflow"`

Script runtime for a behavior pack is terminated due to a stack overflow (a long, and potentially infinite) chain of function calls.
