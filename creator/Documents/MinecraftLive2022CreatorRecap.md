# Minecraft Live 2022 Creator Recap

This year's Minecraft Live was packed with a lot of announcements! The focus of this year's Minecraft: Bedrock Edition creator segment was the [Minecraft Entity Wizard](MinecraftEntityWizard.md) for the model editor Blockbench.  

Coming soon, we will also be releasing the Minecraft Block Wizard in Blockbench: a feature that will make it easier to make custom blocks. Customize your block without needing to touch the code: Destroy time, explosion resistance, friction, flammability, light, sound, and more. If you can dream it, you can make it!

When it comes to creator tools, Blockbench is just one of many tools available to you. If you're curious about other resources, check out the creator [home page](https://learn.microsoft.com/minecraft/creator/) or jump right to a directory of [commonly used tools](CommonlyUsedTools.md).

Have a creation you'd like to share with the Minecraft Creator team? Post on Twitter with #MinecraftCreator!

Segment for creator tools during Minecraft Live 2022.

## Entity Wizard

Create your own mob in less than 30 seconds?! You better believe it! The Minecraft Entity Wizard allows for a simple way to quickly make an entity and get it to the game, thus removing the tedious work of gathering all the files needed for its resource and behavior pack. Build from scratch, start with inspiration and choose the closest likeness in appearance and behavior, or create a wacky mash-up – such as a dolphin with the terrifying behavior of a phantom, or maybe a warden with the calm attitude of a snow golem. Everything is possible!  

**Prerequisites**

After you have downloaded Blockbench, the Minecraft Entity Wizard is a plugin you can add.

1. Navigate to **File --> Plugins**.
1. Search for **Entity Wizard**.
1. Install the plugin.

**Resources**

- Download [Blockbench.](https://www.blockbench.net/)
- Learn how to use the [Entity Wizard](MinecraftEntityWizard.md).
- Maker Series: Step-by-step guide to create a [Goblin Chef from scratch!](MakerSeriesMakingTheGoblinChef.md)

## Minecraft Block Wizard – Coming Soon!  

Inspired by and fueled by the excitement we've seen for Minecraft Entity Wizard, we've partnered with Blockbench's creator, Jannis, to make it equally easy to create custom blocks!  

You will be able to expand your world even further with new materials and objects. Upon release, a tutorial will be created. 

## Minecraft Live 2022 Pack
 
> *"I am so excited about the Minecraft Entity Wizard! My students have had so many ideas and the program is easier to use than we thought it would be. In one class, they were able to modify the appearance and behavior of Minecraft mobs to fit their vision. Students created everything from mimic monsters to their family dog. I can't wait to see what they do with more time using the program."*
> **-- Beth Bachuss, Austin High School, Minecraft Education Partner**

For fun, we enlisted several individuals of various skills to create contributions for the .mcaddon pack for Bedrock Edition, linked here below. 
The goal of the Minecraft Live 2022 pack is to celebrate and showcase how easy the Entity Wizard is to use and that it's possible for anyone to be a creator and make your own mob!  

As a disclaimer, the mobs included in this pack are not indicative towards official Minecraft game design or of what may be added in the future. They were also created with intentional disparity in polish and imagined potential.

**Download the .mcaddon pack**

### Contributor statements  

|Mob Name| Author | Story |
|:----|:----|:----|
|Biceson | Benton Brost + Connor @ Minecraft| The Biceson is an icy elemental relative of the American Bison. It behaves like a polar bear and looks like a snowy icy bison. Its ability is to charge, throw snowballs and icicles, and we imagined it could create paths of ice where it walks, making other creatures slip.|
|Black Bear | Beth B. | Our Austin High School mascot - we made this together as a class! Austin High School is a public high school in the USA. |
|Boomfly | Jackson F. | I made the Boomfly because I wanted a fun take on the phantom. When it's night and players are running from exploding phantoms falling from the sky. I think it would add a new fear to the night similar to how the warden added a new fear to the caves. |
|Booshroom | Chloe @ Minecraft | Booshroom comes out to play when you're pulling an all-nighter and haven't slept. I imagine the Booshroom would make it easy to get a good night's sleep by dropping beds instead of phantom membrane.  |
| Butterfly | Olivia | A butterfly with the behavior of a bee!  |
|Eyeder | Rob @ Minecraft | A spider whose head is a giant eyeball! |
|Flying Cow | Trip B. | I felt like having a cow flying around would be surprising! |
|Frost Moose | Kayla @ Minecraft | A mystical animal at home in the snow! |
|Ghost | Isah | A ghost that floats through the world like a vex! |
|Hornbill | Stephen @ Minecraft | Not a toucan! |
|Lilydog  | Reagan A. |My mob is a recreation of my pet dog named Lily. I think it will be great to include different types of breeds of dogs in Minecraft, just like cats! |
|Nardolphle | Anjelika @ Minecraft | Started with a dolphin that has turtle behavior. Ended up with a narwhal! |
|Narwhal | Bo P. | One of my favorite and most overlooked animals is the narwhal. I believe it has such an interesting and easy to remember look to it. |
|Pearrot | Rob @ Minecraft | A pear-shaped parrot that can be tamed with apples!|  
|Phoenix | Blake G. | I thought it would be cool to have another attack pet in Minecraft. I also thought it would be cool to have a pet that cannot die. When the phoenix mob is killed it turns back to the baby version of itself. Once tamed, I imagined that it would act as a totem of undying for the player. |
|Raccoon | Dylan C. | The raccoon is a mob that will spawn in any forest biome and sometimes plains. They will walk around, climb trees, and just be a form of entertainment to the player. |
|Robot  | Sebastian S. | I made this as a way to introduce a more synthetic mob to the game and with the hope it would create a more challenging mob for the overworld. |
|Sea Chicken | Chloe @ Minecraft | Literal chicken of the sea! I also think it's kind of funny how it still drops salmon! |
|Sheepomelon  | Rob @ Minecraft | A sheep that looks like a watermelon that gives you melon slices when you shear it. |
|Smick Mimic | Jaylon B. | Smick will be found in a new biome in the end. It is a shulker that has learned to mimic chests. |
|Snow Wizard | Chloe @ Minecraft | Spreads snow wherever it goes and defends against hostile mobs by throwing snowballs instead of potions! |
|Spooky Golem | Jack S. | I made my "Spooky Golem" because I really, really like Halloween. Seeing as there was a Snow Golem in the game, I thought it could be fun to try and create a Halloween-themed Golem, which would be decrepit, but somehow still moving around from beyond the grave. Spooky! |
|Wraith  | Jordan J. | The wraith is a resurrected evoker. I chose to make the wraith because since the player gets the totems from the evoker, it would only make sense for the evoker to be able to use them, too. I imagine the wraith is a stronger version of the evoker. |
